            <h1>What is sustainability?</h1>
            <p>Sustainability focuses on meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. 
                <br>
                In this way, we can say that resources exploitation, manufacturing operations, the direction of investments, technological developments, wealth distribution, institutional changes, among others, are being sustainable if they don’t hurt the ecosystem services and if they allow for society’s quality of life not to decrease.
            </p>

            <h1>Why is it important?</h1>
            <p>Sustainability is important for a very simple, very straightforward reason: we cannot maintain our quality of life as human beings, the diversity of life on Earth, or Earth’s ecosystems unless we embrace it. There are indications from all quarters and from the smallest to the largest scale that sustainability is something we must address. We will run out of fossil fuels. Thousands if not millions of animal species will become extinct. We will run out of lumber. We will damage the atmosphere beyond repair… If we don’t change.

                And the root of that change lies in understanding and striving for sustainability—in our own homes, in our communities, in our ecosystems, and around the world.

                <h1>About us</h1>
                <p>Our names are Marco and Afonso. We are two students taking a degree in software engineering on Polytechnic Institute of 
                    Setúbal. We are making this website for the curricular unit of IP (Internet Programming). This website was really
                    our first website ever and was about a really important topic to us. Sustainability will be a very important
                    topic to discuss in the upcoming years as we grow as a population and continue to exponentially fall short of resources.
                    Our objective with this website was to give a simple explanation about Sustainability and help understand what some
                    countries and universities are doing to help achieve this.

                <h1>Our University</h1>
                <p>IPS is situated in the Greater Lisbon Metropolitan Area, region of Setúbal. The region is home to strong enterprises in such fields as, for example, paper and motor car industries, and holds a highly important geostrategic position, since it is a gateway to Europe. Furthermore, Setúbal region, with its varied landscape composed of sea and mountains, including a large protected area with an application in progress to UNESCO Human Heritage, is a tourist destination for both Portuguese and foreigners.
                    IPS was created in 1979 and started activity in 1981. At present the IPS comprises five Higher Education Schools. It also integrates a Students’ Welfare Unit and a number of functional units and central services.
                    Although we're happy with the policies that IPS is implementing, we think that we could do much more to try to pass the message of a sustainable future
                    and try to show to our people, what we can achieve with Sustainability. We should not think only about us, we have to think ahead and care for the future generations
                    that will come to this planet.
